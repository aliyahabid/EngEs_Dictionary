**Preliminary Note**: This program is a personal project to refresh and expand my knowledge of and practice with 
the Spanish language and python.

**Primary goal**:
Allow users to search and receive English-Spanish and Spanish-English translations for words and/or short phrases.

The program will not translate sentences, excluding colloquial expressions and common phrases.

**Steps**:
1. Store as many translations as possible in (python) dictionaries distinguished by parts of speech. 
2. Write code to allow a user to search through the dictionaries to receive appropriate translation(s) 
regardless of the part of speech after identifying whether functions, conditional statements, loops, and/or 
other blocks of code are the most effective ways to do so. 
3. Write code to allow users to find a translation of a word or phrase regardless of capitalization. 
4. Optional: Write code for a basic window and/or GUI for user input and their results.
